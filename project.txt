The ISD team needs to assess the learner needs and project needs. This process can resemble investigation: Is the perceived problem real? Are there hidden problem elements? CAN training solve this problem? Are sufficient numbers required to attend? Is the audience computer-competent? Do they have access to computers? Can they access audio or attend at scheduled times? Do they speak English? Is there resistance to change? Are stakeholder expectations clear? The unknown has the power to undermine a great effort. You must find answers quickly and efficiently. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"RO_D1_caption","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"RO_D1_caption","title":"Design is where solutions are made. The ISD develops enabling objectives, an assessment strategy, and the course structure outlined. Desing documents help the ISD develop a standard approach to similar learning challenge. Much of our design, including chunking and standardized approaches are managing cognitive load and streamlining knowledge transfer. A storyboard will communicate our plan to stakeholder and subject matter experts (SMEs). The actual written content will be created at this stage. Besides presenting design to the stakeholder, the storyboard is also a specification document directing supporting developer activities. We won’t develop custom images, interaction, video, or audio, until we confirm stakeholder approval.  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"RO_D2_caption","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"RO_D2_caption","title":"Development is the assembly area. It also involves some of the more demanding work. Development may involve documents for classroom or job aids, a PowerPoint, or web development. The ISD may be developing content with tools like Captivate and Storyline, and tools for video, audio, and visual creation and editing. Sometimes development is done by the ISD alone and other times by a team of specialists under ISD direction. Robust testing is an important part of development. The last step in development is to assemble the course in the LMS for sample audience testing, called beta testing. Here we’ll observe learners and attempt to identify flaws in our design. We’ll make changes to improve effectiveness and usability. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"RO_I_caption","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"RO_I_caption","title":"The implementation phase of the process involves the release and delivery of learning. This includes installing course files on a learning management system, testing the course, and correcting any issues. Much of this work happens during beta testing. Once the course if finalized, the stakeholder needs to provide the final sign-off. The ISD team needs to secure course source files for later editing and updating. Then managers can make the course available and modify the learner parameters. The course is now live and ready for learners.  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"RO_E_caption","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"RO_E_caption","title":"Evaluation is part of the instructional design process, but not of the course design/development project, and occurs after a course is launched. Ideally, this is performed independently. Evaluation can be as shallow as surveying learners for satisfaction. Measuring learning gains with pre- and post-tests is a deeper evaluation. Move valuable is measuring how much learning is evident in job performance. The gold standard in evaluation is determining return on investment, by measuring change in problem metrics beginning 30 to 60 days after course delivery, and repeated at intervals.
